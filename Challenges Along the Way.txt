1. Whisper AI struggles with no speech/whitenoise during the recording if its placed at the front of the recording.
  -> logprob_threshold and no_speech_threshold being used should help but it didnt help
  -> didnt help either with the recording being at 8KHz
  -> might have to try with large and base model (OH HEY LARGE MODEL ACTUALLY WORKS!)
 
 2. Live transcribe for Whisper AI is done but its not really live since we have to record it at times and then transcribe it
  -> we can try to just transcribe stuff intervally 
  
 3. Large model needs a lot of memory
  -> with google colab, the model sometimes makes it run OOM so that it might help to run it from server
